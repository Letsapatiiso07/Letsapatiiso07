### 💳 Credit Risk Assessment Model
*Fintech | Machine Learning | Risk Modeling | XGBoost*  
End-to-end machine learning system for predicting loan default risk using borrower financial and demographic data.  

**🎯 Key Features & Results:**
- **AUC-ROC: 0.945** (excellent predictive performance)
- Comprehensive EDA, outlier handling, and feature engineering (e.g., debt-to-income ratio)
- Model comparison: XGBoost outperformed Logistic Regression and KNN
- Interpretable insights via feature importance and visualizations
- Production-ready pipeline with preprocessing and evaluation metrics

**📊 Technical Highlights:**
```python
# Top predictive features identified:
- Loan grade & interest rate (highest risk drivers)
- Debt-to-income ratio (engineered feature)
- Home ownership status (renters higher risk)
- Loan amount and percent income
```
**💡 Why It Matters:**
- Demonstrates real-world fintech application of ML for credit scoring
- Handles class imbalance and provides actionable risk insights
- Strong addition to financial domain expertise (complements Diploma in Financial Management)

**🔗 Tech Stack:** Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • XGBoost • Matplotlib • Seaborn

│                     │   │                      │   │                     │
│ • REST/GraphQL APIs │   │ • AWS API Gateway    │   │ • AWS Lambda        │
│ • IoT Sensors/MQTT  │   │ • Amazon Kinesis     │   │ • Step Functions    │
│ • Database CDC      │   │ • AWS EventBridge    │   │ • Glue ETL Jobs     │
│ • File Uploads      │   │ • SQS/SNS Queues     │   │ • Error Handling    │
│ • Streaming Data    │   │ • Scheduled Triggers │   │ • Dead Letter Queue │
